This research focuses on the impact of host reputation and trust-building mechanisms on guest satisfaction and sentiment in Airbnb stays, using data from listings and guest reviews in Bangkok, Thailand. It aims to identify key host attributes affecting guest satisfaction and explore how these factors can be addressed.

Two research questions guide the investigation:

- What factors influence guest sentiment, and how can host reputation and trust-building mechanisms address them?
- How does sentiment in reviews mentioning hosts relate to host reputation and trust-building strategies?

## Dataset
Data was collected from two datasets: Airbnb's Bangkok listing data and review data from insideairbnb.com. 

## Methodology
The study employs a mixed-methods approach involving qualitative sentiment analysis and quantitative regression modeling. Data is gathered from Airbnb listings and reviews, with data preparation including cleaning and filtering for analysis.

Qualitative analysis uses sentiment scores to understand guest sentiments in reviews, identifying factors contributing to positive or negative sentiment. Quantitative analysis utilizes Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to assess the impact of host attributes on guest satisfaction metrics.

## Discussion
The results indicate that factors such as responsive communication from hosts, instant booking availability, and reasonable pricing positively influence guest sentiment. Surprisingly, achieving superhost status and maintaining high host acceptance rates may negatively impact guest sentiment.

The research provides practical insights for hosts and platforms to enhance trust and satisfaction in the peer-to-peer accommodation industry. Hosts can improve their reputation by ensuring timely communication and offering instant booking, aligning with guest preferences. Airbnb and similar platforms can use these findings to enhance their services.
